# Contribution Guidelines

- Recently the quality of MOOCs has diminished, therefore only MOOCs with comprehensive lecture material which cover a subject/topic in ample detail will be added. For example, MOOC on Computer Networks or Machine Learning with 4-5 hours may not be able to cover all topics in sufficient detail and thus should be avoided.
